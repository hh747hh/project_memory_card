<h1>Project #1
"So, You think you have a good memory?"
</h1>

Technologies used
I combined html, css and javascript tools to create the app that challenge your memory!


The approach taken
I actually meant to make a game that matched tiles will remained flipped. On the way of coding, I encountered that it resets the program once you 'click' the unmatched letter. I thought that will be more challenging to people to improve their memory so I decided to pursue this approach.


Game instructions
1. First, you will see the sixteen tiles that contains eight pairs of different letters inside.
2. Your goal is to memorize where these letters are located within 3 seconds.(USE YOUR FLASH MEMORY POWER!!!)
3. After three seconds, all sixteen tiles will be covered with black.
4. Now 'click' each tile to find the match letter. Once it matches, those match letters will be stayed flipped. If you 'click' the tile that has unmatched letter, all your tiles that has been flipped will all turn back to black tile.
5. Start over!

unsolved problems
Still couldn't figure it out how to keep the matched card stayed flipped. needs to work on it more!!!
