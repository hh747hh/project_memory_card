## "So, You think you have a good memory?"


### Technologies Used :
##### I combined html, css and javascript tools to create the app that challenges your memory!


### The Approach Taken :
##### I actually meant to make a game that matched tiles that will remain flipped. On the process of coding, I encountered an issue where it resets the program once you 'click' the unmatched letter. I thought that bug would be more challenging to people to improve their memory so I decided to pursue this approach.


### Game instructions & User stories
##### 1. First, you will see the sixteen tiles that contains eight pairs of different letters inside.
##### 2. Your goal is to memorize where these letters are located within 3 seconds.(USE YOUR FLASH MEMORY POWER!!!)
##### 3. After three seconds, all sixteen tiles will be covered with black.
##### 4. Now 'click' each tile to find the matching letter. Once it matches, those matching letters will stayed flipped. If you 'click' the tile that has an unmatched letter, all your tiles that has been flipped will all turn back to black tiles.
##### 5. Start over!

### Unsolved Problems
##### Still couldn't figure it out how to keep the matched cards flipped. Need to work on it more!!!
